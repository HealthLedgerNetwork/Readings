MedCo is the first operational system that enables a group of clinical sites to federate and collectively protect their data in order to share them with external investigators without worrying about security and privacy concerns.

MedCo uses (a) collective homomorphic encryption to provide trust decentralization and end-to-end confidentiality protection, and (b) obfuscation techniques to achieve formal notions of privacy, such as differential privacy

MedCo relies on secure distributed protocols and a new dummy-records addition strategy that enables different privacy/security versus efficiency trade-offs. With its generic architecture, MedCo is easily deployable on top of existing health information systems such as i2b2 or tranSMART.
