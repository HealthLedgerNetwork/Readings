# Summary
Unintended memorization - the fact that machine learning models memorize details about the training data, resulting in significant privacy concerns when sensitive data is used to train the models. Some solutions to this.
Exposure - metric developed to directly quantify the degree to which a model has unintentionally memorized training data.

# Idea: 
Use this metrics in order to make sure that the model really doesn't memorise pacient data before publishing results to the blockchain.
