# Summary
Helen is a coopetitive system for training linear models. Compared to prior work, Helen assumes a stronger threat model by defending against malicious participants. This means that each party only needs to trust itself. Compared to a baseline implemented with a state-of-the-art malicious framework, Helen is able to achieve up to five orders of magnitude of performance improvement. Given the lack of efficient maliciously secure training protocols, we hope that our work on Helen will lead to further work on efficient systems with such strong security guarantees.

# Idea:
Understand how they implemented Helen and try to improve the created system.
